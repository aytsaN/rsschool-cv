## Summary
The enthusiastic and detail-oriented Software Engineer is seeking an opportunity to extend the web development knowledge. Having 3 years experience in ServiceNow development using JavaScript. My current position requires less and less coding and logical task solving skills every year. I, on the other hand, desire the opposite of that. My goal is to change my course from IT Service Management to JavaScript developer. Having a positive outlook and am always willing to learn new traits. I work well both independently and as part of a team.
